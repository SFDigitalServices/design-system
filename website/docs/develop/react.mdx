We do not yet **officially** support React. However, at least partial support
should be possible with CSS-in-JS tools that support Tailwind (such as
[tailwind-styled-components]) by importing{' '}
<GitHubFileLink path='packages/sfgov-design-system/tailwind.config.js'>our
Tailwind configuration</GitHubFileLink> in your own Tailwind config:

```js
// e.g. tailwind.config.js
module.exports = require('sfgov-design-system/tailwind.config')
```
