import tokens from '@sfgov/design-system/css/src/tokens'

This page documents how we use [Docusaurus], modifications we've made,

## Code playgrounds

Markdown code blocks can be automatically turned into editable "playgrounds" with a
live rendering of the HTML above the editor. (We've customized the
[Docusaurus component][code blocks] to look and act a bit differently, but the
underlying implementation is the same.)

```html live
<h1 class="display-lg">This text is editable</h1>
```

Just add the `live` keyword after the `html` or `jsx` language code in the code block
header after the three backticks:

<pre>{'```html live'}</pre>

<pre>{'```jsx live'}</pre>

For longer code samples you may choose to collapse the code editor by adding the
`closed` keyword:

<pre>{'```html live closed'}</pre>

```html live closed
<p>
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  6
  7
  8
  9
  10
</p>
```

All of the [globals](#globals) available in MDX, including our
[documentation components](#documentation-components), are available in the playground
JSX scope.

## Globals

All of the named exports in <GitHubFileLink>website/src/components</GitHubFileLink>
are available in both the global [MDX scope] and in [code playgrounds].

The `tokens` global also allows you to access design tokens defined by the system
in <GitHubFileLink>packages/@sfgov/design-system/css/src/tokens</GitHubFileLink>.

## Documentation components

All of these components are available in the global [MDX scope].

### DoDont

Use the `<DoDont>`, `<Do>`, and `<Dont>` components to display side-by-side examples.
The "do" example should come first (left), and the "don't" second (right).

```jsx live
<DoDont>
  <Do reasons={['Titles should be large', 'Some people canÊ¼t see well']}>
    <h1 className='title-lg m-0 p-16'>Large heading</h1>
  </Do>
  <Dont reasons={['Small text is bad']}>
    <h1 className='text-body font-regular m-0 p-16'>Small heading</h1>
  </Dont>
</DoDont>
```

### InlineSwatch

Use the `<InlineSwatch>` component to display color values within text. Please use
color tokens (`tokens.color...`) instead of literal values. The label can be passed
either as a string via the `label` prop or as children.

```jsx live
<>
  The pool water was <InlineSwatch value={tokens.colors.blue.bright} label='blue' />,
  but somehow my hair turned <InlineSwatch value={tokens.colors.green[2]}>green</InlineSwatch>.
</>
```

## Markdown

Markdown components are [styled by Docusaurus][docusaurus styling] out of the box, but
can be overridden in <GitHubFileLink>website/src/theme/MDXComponents.jsx</GitHubFileLink>.
You can see how some common "prose" elements are rendered below.

- Unordered list item
- Unordered list item

1. Ordered list item
1. Ordered list item

A paragraph with some **strong text** (i.e. bold) and _emphasized text_ (which should not
be italicized), and [a link](/) for good measure.

> This is a block quote.
>
> This is the second paragraph in the block quote.

```
This is a preformatted block without a language identifier.

These
words
should
appear
on
separate
lines.
```

```html
<!-- HTML -->
<p class="m-0">This is a paragraph.</p>
```

```css
/** CSS */
html {
  font-size: 100px;
}

* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

```js
// JavaScript
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  console.log(`Hello, world #${i}!`)
}
```

```jsx
/* JSX is cool, too */
<SomeAwesomeComponent>
  {({ renderProp }) => JSON.stringify(renderProp)}
</SomeAwesomeComponent>
```

### Admonitions

Admonitions are [Markdown directives], which are written like so:

```markdown
:::{type}
Your content here, including **Markdown**, [links](https://example.com), etc.
:::
```

...where `{type}` is one of `note`, `tip`, `info`, `caution`, or `danger` (`warning` also works).
See [the Docusaurus docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/admonitions) for more info
about the built-in component.

This is a `note` block with [a link in it](/).
