## Tools

- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) is our CSS framework, and provides a
  theme-able suite of utilities that form the backbone of our CSS system.
- [postcss] is our CSS compiler
- [Babel] is our JavaScript compiler
- This [documentation](./documentation) is built with [Docusaurus]
- We use [npm workspaces] and [Turborepo] to orchestrate workflows and builds

## Layout

All of the source files for the published design system packages live in
subdirectories of <GitHubFileLink>packages</GitHubFileLink>.

Source files for this web site live in <GitHubFileLink>website/docs</GitHubFileLink>.

## Workflow

### Setup

1. [Get Node.js] version 14 or greater
1. Clone <a href={repoUrl}>this repository</a> with git
1. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies

### Develop

First, make sure that everything in your development environment
is working by running:

```sh
npm run build
```

This should create files in the `dist/css`, `dist/js`, and
`public` directories. Once you've confirmed that it's working,
you can run one or both of the following:

- `npm run watch` watches the source files and rebuilds the CSS and JavaScript
  bundles when they change
- `npm run develop` starts the Docusaurus server, which includes some helpful
  reloading and debugging features

## Code style

- We lint our JavaScript with [ESlint] and the [eslint-plugin-sfgov] preset.
- We lint our CSS with [stylelint][].
- We lint shell (bash) <GitHubFileLink>scripts</GitHubFileLink> with
  [shellcheck][].
