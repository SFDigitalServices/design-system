## npm

<p>The design system CSS is published as <PackageLink>{pkg.name}</PackageLink> npm. You can
install it in your project with:</p>

<CodeBlock language='sh'>
  npm install {pkg.name}
</CodeBlock>

<p>The current version is <code>{pkg.version}</code>. See the <a href={`https://github.com/${pkg.repository}/releases`}>release history</a> for other
available versions and release notes.</p>

## Versioning

We use [semantic versioning][semver] conventions to number our release versions:

- Bug fixes, documentation updates, and development-related updates are
  **patch** versions, e.g. `1.0.0` → `1.0.1`.

- New features are **minor** versions, e.g. `1.0.0` → `1.1.0`.

- Breaking changes, or any other changes that **may** break any sites that
  upgrade from the previous version, are **major** versions, e.g. `1.0.0` →
  `2.0.0`.

## CDN

There are many content delivery networks that mirror npm packages. For instance,
to import all of the design system CSS from the latest version of the npm
package from [unpkg], you could add the following to your `<head>`:

<CodeBlock language='html'>
  {`<link rel="stylesheet" href="${publishedUrl('/dist/sfds.css')}">`}
</CodeBlock>

See the [CSS guide](/develop/css) for more detailed usage instructions.

## Browser support

Generally speaking, our CSS supports the same browsers as
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/browser-support) (as of version 2.x,
"the latest stable versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari"). Starting in
version 2.0, Tailwind notably introduced the use of [CSS custom properties]
(also known as "CSS variables"), which are
[supported](https://caniuse.com/css-variables) by approximately 95% of browsers
relative to usage as of August, 2021.

### Internet Explorer

**Internet Explorer is not supported**. Microsoft [announced][IE EOL] that it
will no longer support the browser on June 15, 2022, and its usage has declined
rapidly since. In July of 2021 there were **7 unique visitors** using Internet
Explorer on [sf.gov](https://sf.gov).

Support for Internet Explorer is still available in [Tailwind version
1.9](https://v1.tailwindcss.com/). If your project requires IE support, please
[contact us](mailto:ds-support@sfgov.org) and we can offer suggestions for a
custom CSS build.
