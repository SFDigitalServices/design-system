# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `public` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Serve

```
$ npm run serve
```

This serves the built files, which can be useful when debugging issues that crop up in production builds.
