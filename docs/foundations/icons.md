## Intro

SF DesSys icons are visual representations of ideas and actions. These icons allow our users to quickly see interface intent at a glance and take part in establishing hierarchy.

Icons also assist with accessibility in scenarios of low literacy or English proficiency.

## Design Guidelines

### Interface Icons vs. Picture Icons

The San Francisco Design System utilizes two types of images to assist users; interface icons and Picture icons.

Interface icons, or just icons, are generally used to convey an action or intent and are not illustrative or decorative.

Picture icons serve some of the same purposes as the interface icons but in a more expressive way.

### Deciding on a new icon

Before creating a new icon, pause and look for an icon in the SF DesSys icon library that clearly conveys your message; there’s no reason to bloat the icon library for the sake of having variety.

Once you’ve decided that there is a need for a new icon, you have to decide on the best way to represent the concept. In most cases, there is a representation of that idea that already exists.

### Creating a new icon

Great! You’ve decided there is a need for this icon, and you know exactly what it should be. We’ve created guidelines to help your new icon feel like a cohesive member of the San Francisco Design System.

Keylines & base shapes

We utilize keylines to assist with the design of our icons. Having key shapes as part of the icon template allows for uniformity of size and dimension across our libraries and the general shape of the icon.

The shapes contained within our keylines are

##### Style

###### Stroke

Draw interface icons with a consistent 2px stroke both on the inside and outside strokes of the icon.

![Displaying the use of 2px stroke width throughout icon](/assets/icon-stroke-width.png)

###### Corners

The corner radius on the outside of the stroke is 1px, while on the inside of the stroke is 0px.

###### ill vs. no fill

Currently, SFDesSys icons contain no fill beyond the stroke’s fill.

###### Perspective

Make sure to illustrate the icons from the same perspective as the other icons. SFDesSys icons are drawn in a single-point, forward-facing view.

## Usage Guidelines

### When to use

It’s primarily up to the designer when to introduce an icon to their design. The designer should ask if an icon will enhance the experience of the user or create noise and confusion.

### How to use

###### Sizing

The icons are sized at 20px and should generally not be scaled beyond that size.

###### Margins & padding

We’ve created all icons 2px padding, and that padding should not be infringed upon by other icons or text.

###### Alignment

The icons should be center aligned to the accompanying label and not to the baseline of the icon.

###### Placement

A label should generally accompany icons with a few exceptions.

*A Yes/No Component*

###### Color

Icons should be a single color and have the same color as their label.
