# San Francisco Design System Storybook

In [The Workshop and the Storefront], design system consultant and creator of
[atomic design][] [Brad Frost] explains how design systems can benefit from
separating design and developer documentation into environments that better
meet each audience's needs. If the San Francisco Design System [website]
is our storefront, then this [Storybook] application is our workshop.
